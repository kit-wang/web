			Cantonese, commonly spoken in the southern regions of Canton (GuangDong), is a Chinese language (yes, a language). Although Cantonese and Mandarin share periodic similiarities, the speakers of each dialect often are unable to comprehend the other dialect due to the differences in their pronunciations. Even within areas that speak Cantonese, regional dialects (Hong Kong Cantonese and Taishanese) add their own twist to the once dominating language of China. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The Chinese languages are known for their tonal features, which means that the pitch contour of the voice while saying a syllable is a distinctive feature that differentiates words in the language, and homophones often further the reliance of Cantonese speakers on context. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Fun fact: written and spoken Cantonese are wildly different
		<br>
		<br>
		While it depends on the region in which the dialect of Cantonese is spoken, native speakers often use the traditional Chinese writing system, which incorporates... well, traditional radicals and characters, distinguishing itself from the simplified system. Traditional characters typically involve more strokes, and some characters may include over 57 strokes. Pretty complicated, I know.

				<p>Cantonese is an analytic language where the arrangement and order of words in a sentence is important to its meaning. Although the basic sentence structure follows a subject-verb-object rule, this arrangement is often altered and manipulated to emphasize parts of a sentence.</p>
