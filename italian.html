			<br>
			<br>
			As a Romance language, Italian is largely derived from Vulgar Latin, a linkage that is made evident with the similarities in their verb conjugations (and various words in Italian resemble those in latin; what a surprise!). In fact, Italian is the closest language related to Latin. 
			The Italian alphabet is unique in its composition, as it includes 21 letters, and the letters j, k, w, x, and y are excluded.
		<br>
		<br>
		In addition, there is a wide variety of Italian dialects spoken across Italy and Europe overall, as seen in the differently colored regions in the map. The language is also known for its hilarious and unique idioms, some of which you can check out <a href="https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/11-best-italian-expressions-and-sayings">here</a>

				<h1>Phonology</h1>
				<p>Italian is a highly phonetic language. This means that each sound is (almost) always graphically represented by the same combination of letters, so words naturally sound like their spelling, which is in stark contrast to a language like English. 
				<br><br>
				For instance, the "gn" sound in Italian is almost always an equivalent of the Spanish "Ã±"

				<h1>Grammar</h1>
				<p>Italian grammar is reasonably simple. Like in English, sentences often follow the subject-verb-object structure, though some exceptions are to be expected. When describing a noun with an adjective, the noun typically precedes the adjective

				"The red pen" in Italian would be "la penna rossa" (the pen red)

				<h1>Vocabulary</h1>
				<p>Because Italian shares many cognates with other related languages, it is quite easy to build and develop one's vocabulary (view it as a toolset!). When writing out large numbers, there are no numbers or punctuations between the individual units, meaning that 555 in Italian is essentially "fivehundredfiftyfive," or "cinquecentocinquantacinque" (this is also a common tongue twister).</p>
