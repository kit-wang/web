			Korean: one of the world's youngest languages. It was created by King Sejong the Great in the 15th century who aimed to increase literacy rates, as traditional Chinese was the standard written language and it was not exactly the easiest to learn. 
			<br><br>
			In Korean, small and large numbers use different systems of counting. One counting system uses native Korean vocabulary, and is used for saying your age, counting objects, and expressing the hour when telling time. This system goes up to 99. The other system is of Chinese origin (Sino-Korean system), and is used for expressing the minutes when telling time, as well as several other measurements such as distance, money, and dates.
			<br><br>
		For English learners, Korean's writing system may initially seem completely new, but with practice, your Hangeul (한글) recognition and handwriting can definitely improve!

				<h1>Phonology</h1>
				<p>Although Hangeul (the Korean writing system) may initially appear pretty daunting, Korean is almost entirely phonetic, which means that you may sound out any word if you have memorized the alphabet (given there are of course certain exceptions to general pronunciation rules in more complex character structures).</p>

				<h1>Grammar</h1>
				<p>Instead of the typical subject-verb-object sentence structure seen in English and some other languages, Korean utilizes a subject-object-verb structure. This particular characteristic is similar to other languages, such as Japanese.</p>

				<h1>Vocabulary</h1>
				<p>Currently, approximately 60% of Korean vocabulary can be traced back to Chinese characters and their pronunciations (there have also been an increasing English loan word percentage!), and some proverbs are shared between the two languages. 35% of the words are purely Korean, and 5% are actually loan words stemming from languages such as English.</p>
