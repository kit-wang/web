		<p>Korean --- one of the world's youngest languages. It was created by King Sejong the Great in the 15th century as an attempt to increase literacy rates (as traditional Chinese was the standard written language). Although Hangul (the Korean writing system) may initially appear pretty daunting, Korean is almost entirely phonetic, which means that you may sound out any word if you have memorized the alphabet (given there are of course certain exceptions to general pronunciation rules in more complex character structures ). Instead of the typical subject-verb-object sentence structure seen in English and some other languages, Korean utilizes a subject-object-verb structure. This particular characteristic is similar to Japanese syntax.
		<br>
		<br>
		Currently, approximately 60% of Korean vocabulary can be traced back to Chinese characters and their pronunciations (there have also been an increasing English loan word percentage!), and some proverbs are shared between the two languages. 
		<br>
		<br>
		For English learners, Korean's writing system may initially seem completely new, but with practice, your Hangul recognition and handwriting can definitely improve!
