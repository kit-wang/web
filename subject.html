	<h3>Here are some languages that I have been learning/have learned so far!</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Italian</li>
		<li>Korean</li>
		<li>Russian</li>
		<li>Cantonese</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Each language is uniquely distinct, and full of its own defining characteristics, so that's what this webpage is all about!</h5>

	<div class="sub-heading">
		<h2>Italian</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		Being a prominent Romance language, Italian is largely derived from Vulgar Latin, a linkage that is made evident with the similarities in their verb conjugations (and various words in Italian resemble those in latin; what a surprise!). In terms of grammar, Italian is a relatively straightforward language, with consistent rules, though exceptions to general rules are occasional
	</p>
	<p>
		For instance, despite common classification rules, the word "hand" in Italian, or "mano," is a feminine noun that utilizes a definite article of "la".
	</p>
	<p>
		It is also intriguing to note that Italian is an inflected language, meaning that a word's definition could be changed by altering their endings. When contrasted with English pronounciation, Italian pronounciation and spelling can be very easy to pick up: words are spelled like they sound, and letters are pronounced the way you expect them to be pronounced!

		<h2>Korean</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		Korean --- one of the world's youngest languages. It was created by King Sejong the Great in the 15th century as an attempt to increase literacy rates (as traditional Chinese was the standard written language). Although Hangul (the Korean writing system) may initially appear pretty daunting, Korean is almost entirely phonetic, which means that you may sound out any word if you have memorized the alphabet (given there are of course certain exceptions to general pronunciation rules in more complex character structures ). Instead of the typical subject-verb-object sentence structure seen in English and some other languages, Korean utilizes a subject-object-verb structure. This particular characteristic is similar to Japanese syntax. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Currently, approximately 60% of Korean vocabulary can be traced back to Chinese characters and their pronunciations (there have also been an increasing English loan word percentage!), and some proverbs are shared between the two languages.

	<div class="sub-heading">
		<h2>Russian</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		The Russian language is full of consecutive consonants, and utilizes the Cyrillic alphabet. Compared to the other languages discussed here, Russian has a complex set of grammar rules, and exceptions are numerous. Even though a typical sentence is organized in a subject-verb-object structure, its plethora of grammatical guidelines allows for a very flexible word order, which may be surprising. The language also has six different grammatical cases, forcing new learners to navigate through a challenging alphabet AND a complex grammatical system.
	</p>
	<p>
		One notable characteristic of Russian is its lack of articles, be it definite or indefinite. Despite this, there are still numerous ways to say "the" by using pronouns as defining indicators. Similar to Korean, Russian is also very phonetic (much more than English), mainly due to the fact that it only shares an alphabet (sort of) with a few highly related languages. Personally, nailing the exact pronunciation of words and letters in Russian has posed a difficult challenge. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Though the Russian cursive writing system may appear seemingly impossible to decipher at first sight, it is very commonly used by people (and it's such a beautiful writing system as well).

		<h2>Cantonese</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		Cantonese, commonly spoken in the southern regions of Canton, is a dialect of "Chinese." Although Cantonese and Mandarin share periodic vocabulary similiarities, the speakers of each dialect often are unable to comprehend the other dialect due to the differences in their pronunciations. Even within areas that speak Cantonese, regional dialects (Hong Kong Cantonese and Taishanese) add their own twist to the once dominating language of China. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The "Chinese" language is known for its tonal features, which means that the pitch contour of the voice while saying a syllable is a distinctive feature that differentiates words in the language, and homophones often further the reliance of Cantonese speakers on context. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Cantonese alone has nine different tones; there are six distinct pitch contours in Cantonese; an additional three are “entering tones.” By pronouncing the numbers 394052786 in Cantonese, all nine tones/pitches can be demonstrated. 
	</p>
	<p>
		While it depends on the region in which the dialect of Cantonese is spoken, native speakers often use the traditional Chinese writing system, which incorporates... well, traditional radicals and characters, distinguishing itself from the simplified system. Traditional characters typically involve more strokes, and some characters may include over 57 strokes. Pretty complicated, I know.
