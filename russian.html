			<br><br>
			The Russian language utilizes the Cyrillic alphabet, which includes 33 letters. 10 of them are vowels, and 21 are consonants. The remaining two do not have a sound.  
		<br>
		<br>
		One notable characteristic of Russian is its lack of articles, be it definite or indefinite. Despite this, there are still numerous ways to say "the" by using pronouns as defining indicators. Surprisingly, there are only approximately 200,000 words in the Russian language, and native Russian speakers actually use very few of these words, as many words take on multiple meanings.  
		<br>
		<br>
		Though the Russian cursive writing system may appear extremely difficult to decipher at first sight, it is very commonly used by people (and it's just beautiful as well). If you are interested in learning to read Cyrillic, start <a href="https://www.babbel.com/russian-alphabet">here</a>.

				<h1>Phonology</h1>
				<p>Similar to Korean, Russian is also very phonetic (much more than English), mainly due to the fact that it only shares an alphabet (sort of) with a few highly related languages. Personally, nailing the exact pronunciation of words and letters in Russian has posed a difficult challenge.</p>

				<h1>Grammar</h1>
				<p>Compared to the other languages discussed here, Russian has a complex set of grammar rules, and exceptions are numerous. Even though a typical sentence is organized in a subject-verb-object structure, its plethora of grammatical guidelines allows for a very flexible word order. The language also has six different grammatical cases, forcing new learners to navigate through a challenging alphabet AND a complex grammatical system.</p>

				<h1>Vocabulary</h1>
				<p>As mentioned previously, the Russian language contains a much smaller vocabulary than others. Many words are only one syllable, or even one character ("я" is "I" in Russian). However, adjectives are typically longer and have 2+ syllables.</p>
